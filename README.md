</p>
I applied <b>Clean Architecture</b> to build the REST API. Clean architecture has a domain layer, Application Layer, Infrastructure Layer, and Presentation Layer

### Advantages of Clean Architecture
<ul>
  <li>The immediate implementation can implement this architecture with any programming language.</li>
  <li>
    The domain and application layer are always the center of the design and are known as the core of the system that why the core of the system is not dependent on external systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    This architecture allows to change the external system without affecting the core of the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a highly testable environment, can test the code quickly and easily.
  </li>
  <li>
    Can create a highly scalable and quality product.
  </li>
</ul>
